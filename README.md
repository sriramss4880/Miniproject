# TOWARDS ACCURATE LUNG CANCER DETECTION: COMPARITIVE ANALYSIS USING CNN MODEL

The project aims to analyze and compare the performance of different Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures for detecting cancerous nodules in lung CT scans. It focuses on selecting the most efficient model for accurate and early diagnosis of lung cancer, contributing to improved healthcare outcomes.


## About
<!--Detailed Description about the project-->
Comparative Analysis of Lung Cancer Detection Using CNN Models on CT Scan Images is a project designed to evaluate the effectiveness of advanced CNN architectures in detecting lung cancer. Early detection of lung cancer is vital to improve survival rates, and traditional diagnostic methods are often time-consuming, invasive, or reliant on subjective interpretations. This project addresses these challenges by applying deep learning techniques to lung CT scans. The study compares multiple pre-trained CNN models to determine the optimal one based on performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and AUC.

The chosen model leverages the power of convolutional layers for feature extraction, enabling automated, scalable, and accurate detection of cancerous nodules in medical images.
